{"name":"Simplification","tagline":"Simplify the web and remove unwanted clutter.","body":"Simplification\r\n==============\r\n\r\nSimplification is a small (3.86 KB minified, 6.65 KB unminified) bookmarklet that removes headers, navbars, widgets, sidebars, forms, breadcrumbs and more at the click of a bookmark. Simplification also changes the font to make it larger and more readable, and will, if I get around to it, remove background images and other distractions as well (possibly by adding another stylesheet to the page).\r\n\r\nSimplification works by looping through the DOM of a page and comparing each element to a blocked list of element names, classes and IDs. You can it for yourself at [my GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/fridgefish/simplification/tree/gh-pages/simplification.js)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Installing Simplification\r\nSimplification is a bookmarklet. Bookmarklets pretend to be a bookmark, but the URL is actually JS.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n#### Install the bookmarklet that grabs the file ####\r\nCreate a new bookmark with the name \"Simplification\" and set the URL parameter to the contents of simplfication_bookmarklet.min.js (you can see it on the github repo of Simplification). Once you've installed Simplification, go ahead and try it on any website by clicking the \"Simplification\" bookmarklet. Try it on this one!\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\nSimplification is licenced under the Apache Licence 2.0. It's free and open source software!\r\n\r\n## The Author\r\nMy name is Fridgefish, or Matt if you prefer, and I coded this over a few afternoons.\r\nI got the idea from extensions like Readability and Evernote's Clearly, but they used NLP which I didn't quite want to delve into.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n*Doesn't seem to work on HTTPS sites* This is because the site the script is sourced from is not HTTPS. To fix, if you're using Chrome, click the shield in the far right of the URL bar and click \"Run unsafe script\"\r\n\r\n*Doesn't work on every website* This is because the name for the navbar, footer, widget etc is not on the blocked list. Please report a bug, it'll help a lot! :smile:\r\n\r\n*Doesn't work with some privacy extensions* Please fridgefish.github.io (dependig on if I'm going to send it there). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Thanks, and enjoy your Simplified web!####\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
