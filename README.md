Simplification
==============

Simplification is a small (3.86 KB minified, 6.65 KB unminified) bookmarklet that removes headers, navbars, widgets, sidebars, forms, breadcrumbs and more at the click of a button.

## Installing Simplification
Simplification is a bookmarklet. Bookmarklets pretend to be a bookmark, but the URL is actually JS.

There are two ways to install:
##### Install the bookmarklet that grabs the file #####
Create a new bookmark with the name "Simplification" and set the URL parameter to the contents of simplfication_bookmarklet.min.js


##### Install the file directly #####
Create a new bookmark with the name "Simplification" and set the URL parameter to the contents of simplfication.min.js

_Little Notey Note: Yes, I know I'm using RawGit, but it's a temporary measure until I can find something else (like github.io, or on my own site once I've finished it :smile:)._

## Licence
Simplification is licenced under the Apache Licence 2.0. It's free and open source software! (well, duh, it _is_ on GitHub)

## The Author
My name is Fridgefish, or Matt if you prefer, and I coded this over a few afternoons.
I got the idea from extensions like Readability and Evernote's Clearly, but they used NLP which I didn't quite want to delve into.

## Issues
*Doesn't seem to work on HTTPS sites* This is because the site the script is sourced from is not HTTPS. To fix, either install Simplification using the _Install the file directly_ method, or if you're using Chrome, click the shield in the far right of the URL bar and click "Run unsafe script"
*Doesn't work on every website* This is because the name for the navbar, footer, widget etc is not on the blocked list. Please report a bug, it'll help a lot! :smile:
*Doesn't work with some privacy extensions* Please allow cdn.gitraw.com access in your privacy extension. Alternatively, install using the _Install the file directly_ method.


Thanks, and enjoy your Simplified web!
