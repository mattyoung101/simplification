Simplification
==============

Simplification is a small (3.86 KB minified, 6.65 KB unminified) bookmarklet that removes headers, navbars, widgets, sidebars, forms, breadcrumbs and more at the click of a button.

## Installing Simplification
Grab simplification_bookmarklet.min.js and copy the contents to the clipboard. The process should be the same for most browsers, but buttons may have different text.

Create a new bookmark with the name "Simplification" and click Edit.
Change the URL to the contents of simplification_bookmarklet.min.js (it's on your clipboard :) )
Click Save, and now open the bookmarklet and watch the clutter go _hazzam_ off the page!

## Licence
Simplification is licenced under the Apache Licence 2.0. It's free and open source software! (well, duh, it _is_ on GitHub)

## The Author
My name is Fridgefish, or Matt if you prefer, and I coded this over a few afternoons.
I got the idea from extensions like Readability and Evernote's Clearly, but they used NLP which I didn't quite want to delve into.

## Issues
There's a collection of issues in the source of Simplificaiton (simplification.js) that I can't be bothered to rewrite (sorry).
Also check out the bug page!
If it doesn't work, make sure to create a new issue here.


Thanks, and enjoy your Simplified web!
