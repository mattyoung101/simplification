Simplification
==============

Small bookmarklet I made ages ago that removes that removes website clutter such as headers, navbars, widgets, sidebars, forms, breadcrumbs and more, so you can focus on the article's content.

## Installing Simplification
There are two ways to install:    
##### Install the bookmarklet that grabs the file #####
Create a new bookmark with the name "Simplification" and set the URL parameter to the contents of simplfication_bookmarklet.min.js
*Note: Simplification is stored on github.io. To get the production safe source code of Simplification, switch to the branch "gh-pages".

## Licence
Simplification is licenced under the Apache Licence 2.0. It's free and open source software!

## Issues
*Doesn't seem to work on HTTPS sites* This is because the site the script is sourced from is not HTTPS. To fix, if you're using Chrome, click the shield in the far right of the URL bar and click "Run unsafe script"

*Doesn't work on every website* This is because the name for the navbar, footer, widget etc is not on the blocked list. Please report a bug, it'll help a lot! :smile:

*Doesn't work with some privacy extensions* Please whitelist cdn.gitraw.com or github.io (dependig on if I'm going to send it there).
