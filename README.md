Simplification on GitHub.io
==========================

Simplification is a small (3.86 KB minified, 6.65 KB unminified) bookmarklet that removes headers, navbars, widgets, sidebars, forms, breadcrumbs and more at the click of a button.

_This is the hosting branch of Simplification. I recommend grabbing the source from here, because I might break the master repository._
